# Movie Ratings Project üé¨‚≠ê
   
   This project analyzes Fandango‚Äôs movie ratings in 2015 vs 2016 to investigate whether changes in rating distributions were influenced by the correction of a biased rating system, following Walt Hickey‚Äôs analysis.

## Objectives
1) Compare the distribution of ratings between 2015 and 2016.
2) Identify whether ratings in 2016 were generally lower than 2015.
3) Explore possible causes of the observed changes.

## Dataset
- **Fandango 2015** and **2016** datasets (popular movies).
- Data was analyzed using Python.

## Methods
- Data exploration with **pandas** and **numpy**.
- Visualization with **matplotlib**
- Comparison using **summary statistics** (mean, median, mode) and **kernel density plots** and **grouped bar plot**.

## Results
- Mean ratings dropped slightly (by about 0.20 stars) in 2016 compared to 2015.
- The mode shifted from **4.5** in 2015 to **4.0** in 2016.
- The median remained the same (**4.0**), suggesting only a small shift overall.

## Interpretation/Conclusion
Fandango adjusted its rating system after the bias was reported.
